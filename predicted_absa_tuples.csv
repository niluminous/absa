187281,136797,"A very good dish but make sure to use a quality red wine.  I used a grocery store cooking wine so it didn't add as much flavor. This dish has alot of French flair and is a very good meal.  This dish does have alot of saturated fat so we have it on our cheat day! (smile)  Also, you can decrease the amount of oil and butter if you use nonstick spray and a bit of olive oil as the other review suggested.","[('dish', 'very good', 'positive'), ('red wine', 'quality', 'positive'), ('cooking wine', 'did not add as much flavor', 'negative'), ('dish', 'alot of French flair', 'positive'), ('meal', 'very good', 'positive'), ('dish', 'alot of saturated fat', 'negative'), ('oil and butter', 'decrease the amount', 'neutral'), ('nonstick spray', 'bit of olive oil', 'neutral'), ('review', 'suggested', 'neutral')]

20371,13214,"Fantastic! Not only are these both fast and easy to make, but the taste is terrific. Two comments: 1) I used a one-inch scoop and my yield was 40 rum balls; and 2) I'd recommend chilling the mixture for 15-30 mins before forming balls as it makes the process easier.

200875,144878,"I have to give the recipe 5 stars, because this was my first time EVER making a pie crust!! And, though it didn't turn out perfectly, it was pretty darn good! I mixed it by hand and per the suggestion of a baker I know, I didn't use a rolling pin. Lessons learned: I didn't trim enough excess around my edges, so the edge of the crust was too thick. And I didn't roll out the crust enough, so it was pretty dense and thick (it was difficult since I used my hands). But it sure did taste good!
