Text: WORST fudge recipe I have ever had the misfortune of making! It gets one star from me because it apparently worked for other people. This garbage did not set properly, even after over 15 hours. Do NOT make this recipe unless you are willing to risk the colossal waste of time and money.

Text: I just made this for dinner as a side dish to my southwest tamale pie. The only changes I made was to add Thousand Island dressing thats all I had on hand. I also added kidney beans instead of ranch style beans. I forgot the cheese but it was still tasty. Thanks for a quick side dish for dinner.

Text: Delicious!  For the coffee, I dissolved 2 teaspoons instant Espresso Powder in water, since I forgot to save some coffee from the pot.  After stirring in the egg, I tasted it and thought it was missing something, so stirred in a teaspoon of almond extract.  I am going to try other extracts also.  Orange I think would be good!

Text: Awesome!  I couldn't get shallots because I live in China and couldn't find them, but I used a white onion instead.  Delicious and healthy.  I will cook this many more times in the future.  Thank-you.

Text: These aren't healthy. Bisquick is full of junk, sugar substitutes are garbage and even the egg suggests a substitute. Sorry but I won't even try this.

Text: My husband and I loved this.  It did take a long time to make, but was well worth it.  While it had a long prep time, the individual steps were easy to follow.  One thing I learned the hard way though - some pasta manufacturers now make lasagna noodles that do not need to be precooked (softened in the water).  Check the box before you buy!  I accidentally overcooked the noodles, they burnt a bit and were chewy.  That was my own fault though, and not that of the recipes'.  Thanks, Karamia for sharing this with us!

Text: I had an abundance of basil in my garden this year. Unfortunately, it was the only herb that did any good this summer. I had no idea what to do with all of it, and one of my coworkers suggested making pesto. I've always liked pesto, but I didn't even know what was in it! This is delicious! So quick and easy to make! And cheap, too! I may try the walnut version next time. The pine nuts were expensive and hard to find.
